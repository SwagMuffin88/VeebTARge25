        The <a href="https://www.royalkennelclub.com/search/breeds-a-to-z/breeds/pastoral/briard/">briard</a>,
        or berger or brie, is a large breed of dog.

    <h3>
        Breed history
    </h3>
    <p>
        This long coated sheep herd and guard dog originates in the province of Brie in France.
        The breed shares some common ancestry with its short coated 'cousin' the Beauceron and
        references to the breed can be found in 14th century legends. The Briard was exhibited at
        the very first dog show in France in 1863 and gained official recognition in 1897.
        Briards was used in both World Wars by the French army as pack dogs, accompanying search
        parties looking for wounded soldiers.
